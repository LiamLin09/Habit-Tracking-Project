Habit Tracking Project

- you could go to it everyday and just tap on today's date
- then you could track your habit
- we are going to build a digital version of that.
- by using an API called Pixela
- it comes from a Japanese developer, it allows you to track your habit,  but not just show which days you have done, which days you have not, 
	but it also shows the intensity(like leetcode or github website)
- get the graph:  https://pixe.la/v1/users/a-know/graphs/test-graph
